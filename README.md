### My Projects üöÄ

Here are some of the projects I've worked on, showcasing my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems:

* **Loan Approval Classification Model** üè¶
    * **Problem:** Addressed the challenge of risk assessment in financial lending by building a model to predict loan approval/rejection.
    * **Methodology:** Implemented **SMOTE** for dataset imbalance and **log transformation** for skewed features. Trained models using **XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest**.
    * **Outcome:** Achieved best results with **XGBoost (hyper-tuned)**, obtaining an **Accuracy of 0.85, F1 score of 0.90, and ROC-AUC score of 0.88**, providing a robust tool for informed credit decisions.

* **BigMart Sales Prediction Project** üìà
    * **Problem:** Aimed to forecast future sales for BigMart outlets to optimize inventory and sales strategies.
    * **Methodology:** Utilized **XGBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM**. Employed an advanced ensemble method, **Stacking Regressor**, with XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM, and Ridge Regressor as base models, and Ridge Regressor as the meta-model.
    * **Outcome:** Achieved an **R-Squared of 0.6911, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.7260, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 10.0763** after hyper-tuning the Stacked Regressor.

* **E-Commerce Sales Performance Power BI Dashboard** üìä
    * **Problem:** Created an intuitive dashboard to monitor and analyze key sales performance indicators for an e-commerce business.
    * **Methodology:** Designed and implemented an interactive Power BI dashboard, integrating data from multiple sources and creating compelling visualizations.
    * **Outcome:** The dashboard enables quick identification of sales trends, top-performing products, and geographical sales distribution, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven strategic decisions.

* **Telecom Customer Churn Predictive Analysis** üìû
    * **Problem:** Tackled the critical issue of customer churn in the telecom industry by identifying customers at risk of leaving.
    * **Methodology:** Trained models using **Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost**. Addressed class imbalance using `scale_pos_weight`. Created a DataFrame of predictions, merged it with the original dataset, and saved the final DataFrame for comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) analysis in **Power BI**.
    * **Outcome:** Achieved best results with **refined XGBoost hyper-tuning and threshold optimization (0.60 threshold)**, yielding an **Accuracy of 0.7793, F1 score of 0.6371, and ROC-AUC score of 0.8463**.
    * [Repository Link](https://www.github.com/Sonjoy95/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Predictive-Analysis)

* **Online Retail Customer Segmentation** üõçÔ∏è
    * **Problem:** Sought to understand distinct customer groups within an online retail dataset to enable personalized marketing and service.
    * **Methodology:** Applied **K-Means clustering** algorithm, identifying **4 distinct customer groups** based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
    * **Outcome:** **Segmented customers into highly actionable groups:** Loyal Big Spenders (Cluster 3), Promising Regular Spenders (Cluster 1), Occasional Spending Customers (Cluster 0), and Rarely Spending Customers (Cluster 2), enabling tailored marketing campaigns.
